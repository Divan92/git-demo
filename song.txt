I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track. Thunder!
I looked around
And I knew there was no turning back. Thunder!
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do? Thunder!
And I knew
There was no help from you. Thunder!
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart!
The thunder of guns,
Took me apart.

You've been thunderstruck!

Rode down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas. Yeah Texas!
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules played all the fools.
Yeah! Yeah! They, they, blew our minds!

And I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again? Please!
Yeah! The ladies were too kind.
